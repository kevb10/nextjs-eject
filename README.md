## üìÑ Description

Are you looking to scale your NextJS application beyond what the NextJS API can efficiently handle? **@kevb10/nextjs-eject** seamlessly migrates your NextJS API routes to AWS Lambda functions, preparing your app to leverage the power, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of AWS.

This plugin analyzes your NextJS project and generates corresponding Lambda functions for each API route. It sets up the necessary AWS infrastructure without modifying your NextJS code. You simply configure your NextJS app to call the new Lambda endpoints instead of the built-in NextJS API.

Key benefits:

- Effortlessly transition to AWS Lambda backends
- Unlock unlimited scaling potential
- Reduce infrastructure and traffic costs  
- No vendor lock-in, take back control
- Generated Lambda functions are pre-configured and deployment-ready
- Minimal changes required to your existing NextJS project
- Fully customizable to match your infrastructure needs

**@kevb10/nextjs-eject** does all the heavy lifting to get your NextJS application ready for rapid growth. Say goodbye to NextJS API limitations and leverage the performance of AWS Lambda today!
